👋 Welcome visitor, to the fascinating world & life of AQ! 🌎

Let me introduce myself - I'm a passionate computer engineer with an insatiable thirst for everything digital. My heart beats for the Flutter framework, and I've been deeply entrenched in the development industry since 2019 - and I'm still going strong. 🚀

With 4+ years of experience under my belt, I can confidently say that I'm a seasoned pro in Mobile Development via Flutter. 📱 Throughout my journey, I've gained a wealth of contacts, friends, and technical skills that I'm proud to have mastered. Here are a few highlights:

🔹 Strong understanding of OOP principles
🔹 In-depth knowledge of various data structures and how to implement them
🔹 Familiarity with the different network levels of a mobile application
🔹 Basic understanding of the web structure
🔹 Expertise in handling APIs' different responses and parsing them
🔹 Proficiency in UX design and workflow

But that's not all! There's so much more to learn, and I'm always up for a challenge. My ultimate goal is to become a development business owner, leading a team of like-minded individuals to the top of our industry. 💪 However, I know that achieving this vision requires hard work, dedication, and a lot of sweat. This profile will document my journey towards making my dreams a reality.

I hope you enjoy exploring my repositories, and I wish you a lovely, safe, and wonderful life. ❤️
