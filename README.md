Welcome visitor, to the world & life of AQ üëÄ
To introduce myself, I'm a computer engineer who's obsessed with the digital world. Especially Flutter!
I have been in the development industry since 2019 and still going in, my main field of expertise is Mobile
Development via the Flutter framework.
4 years in this field were more than enough to show me the essentials for being a pro in the digital world.
From this journey I gained a lot of contacts, friends and technical skills that I proudly say I'm a master of.
Such as:
- OOP priniciples understanding.
- Different data structures & how to implement them.
- The different network levels of a mobile application.
- Basic understanding of the web structure.
- Handling APIs different responses and parsing them.
- The essentials of UX design & workflow.
And much more!

My goal is to become a development business owner with a team of my kind so we could all reach success & become
on the top of our own world, but this vision requires hard work and sweat. So, this profile will be the history
of how I made my dreams & visions come to life.

I hope that you enjoy your visit through my repos hoping you a lovely, safe and a wonderful life. ‚ù§
